These are all the files I have been working on. I will go through them, sort them are comment them.
Bare with me as I am pretty new still to programing.

Basically though it's working ok, the GUI is not finished but you can run these script from the script editor and just pass 
the parameter to the functions.

I'll try to finish the GUI in about a week.
